# Dotfile configuration for my system.
### Still a WIP and forgoes a lot of system specific configuration files.

This does not include /etc/ configurations and directories such as ~/.ssh for obvious reasons.
You might also want to clone the sh_scripts repo i've created to ~/bin/sh_scripts in order to get
the systemd units, .profile calls, et al working.

**TODO:** A list of Arch packages will be pruned and published
